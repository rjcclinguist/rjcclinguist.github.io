### Lexical stress in French? ###

Currently, I am investigating the absence of word-level stress in French by measuring the brain responses of French vs. English speakers (and bilinguals) while listening to song lyrics. In a musical melody, different accentuation strategies can be applied to a note to make it more prominant relative to its surrounding notes. These types of musical accent are analogous with the phonetic cues for linguistic stress: pitch, duration, and intenisty, so writing a song is an excellent way of individually manipulating each of these correlates.

When an English speaker hears a word with the wrong stress pattern, different neural responses are elicited, corresponding to a difficulty in integration and processing. The same has not been observed in French monolinguals, suggesting a lack of stress in French. With the help of electroencephalograms, my study explores the differences in how francophones, anglophones, and bilinguals react to misalignments between lexical stress and musical accent, in the context of language-to-melody synchronization. We expect English-dominant brains to recognize melodies with deviant stress as incongruous and French-dominant brains to not display a difference. Bilingual experience and musical background are also expected to play a role. This way, we can provide novel evidence from the perception of sung language to support differences in prosodic systems across spoken languages.
