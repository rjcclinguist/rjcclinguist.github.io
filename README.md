### Interests
Autosegmental and metrical phonology, prosody, articulatory phonetics, the psychology of bilingualism, speech-language disorders, and the language-music interface.

#### About me
I am a student at Universtité de Montréal completing a master's degree in theoretical linguistics graduating in 2027. I also did my undergraduate degree at McGill University in linguistics.

I specialize in phonology, the study of sound systems in natural language. Phonologists look to build abstract mathematical models that represent how sounds are generated in our brains. Specifically, I use phonetic data (acoustic measurements) and psycholinguistic data (cognitive information) to make predictions about the patterns of interaction between speech sounds in different languages.

My honours thesis focused on the mental representations of consonants in Chilean Spanish, and how a seemingly long consonant is derived from the convergence of two short consonants.
